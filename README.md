**From Chaos to Clarity: Transforming 30 Years of Indian Stock Market Data into Actionable Insights**

---

## 🚀 TL;DR (Executive Summary)

* Built an **end-to-end analytics pipeline** for **500 Nifty stocks across 30 years (1996–2025)**
* Automated data collection, cleaning, transformation, and modeling using **Python + Power BI**
* Converted raw prices into **returns, volatility, and Sharpe Ratio** for meaningful comparison
* Designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze risk-adjusted performance instantly
* Demonstrated how **mathematics + data science** turn messy real-world data into clarity

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **data analytics pipeline and interactive Power BI dashboard** built on **30 years of historical data for all 500 stocks in India’s Nifty 500 index (1996–2025)**.

What began as a **mathematics poster competition entry** evolved into a full-scale, real-world analytics solution that demonstrates how **mathematics, statistics, Python, and data visualization** come together to solve complex financial problems.

The dashboard enables users to:

* Compare any Nifty 500 stock
* Measure risk and returns
* Identify top and bottom performers
* Analyze long-term market behavior interactively

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Analyzing **500 stocks over 30 years** presents several challenges:

* Massive data volume
* Missing values due to market holidays
* Inconsistent data formats
* Difficulty comparing stocks directly

Raw stock prices alone are misleading. Meaningful analysis requires **percentage returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted metrics**.

---

## ✅ Solution Summary

We built a **six-phase analytics pipeline**:

1. **Automated data collection** using Python
2. **Consolidation** of 500 individual stock files
3. **Transformation** from prices to percentage returns
4. **Restructuring** data for analytics (Unpivoting)
5. **Mathematical modeling** using DAX
6. **Interactive Power BI dashboard** design

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection

* Source: Yahoo Finance
* Tool: `yfinance` (Python)
* Data: Daily OHLC prices for 500 stocks (1996–2025)
* Output: 500 CSV files (~500+ MB)

---

### Phase 2: Data Consolidation

* Extracted **Date** and **Close Price** from each file
* Merged all stocks into a single dataset using Date as the key
* Result: One master CSV with **501 columns** (Date + 500 stocks)

---

### Phase 3: Price to Returns Conversion

* Filled missing values using forward-fill
* Converted prices to **daily percentage returns**

**Formula:**
`Daily Return = ((Price_today - Price_yesterday) / Price_yesterday) × 100`

---

### Phase 4: Power BI Transformation (Breakthrough Phase)

* Problem: 500 stocks stored as columns (wide format)
* Solution: **Unpivot transformation** in Power Query

**Result:**

* Date
* Stock Name
* Daily Return

This step made filtering, comparison, and visualization possible.

**Key Fix:**

* Converted Daily Return from text to decimal
* Replaced NaN and error values

---

### Phase 5: Analytics Engine (DAX Measures)

**1. Average Daily Return**

```
AVERAGE(Returns[Daily Return])
```

**2. Volatility (Risk)**

```
STDEV.P(Returns[Daily Return])
```

**3. Annualized Sharpe Ratio**

```
(Avg Daily Return / Volatility) * SQRT(252)
```

**4. Cumulative Trend Line**
Robust calculation with error handling for long time series.
